# CellularAutomation
This project is my final project for CSYE 6200 course using JavaSwing and some level of thread control.
I'm trying to simulate the growth of a snow flake crystal where 3 patterns can be selected and the max steps can be customized vai a JSlider.
First, Simple Rule is a really simple pattern that generates a haxagon.
Then, Medium Rule is a decent pattern that generates snow the same flake like pattern every time.
And then Complex Rule is a pattern that is spiced up with some randomness -- you can try several time and get different pattern.
Steps can be traced with different color and thus the pattern growth is vivid.

In this project, the CellAutomation_Runnable_Jar.jar file is a  runnable jar of the whole project.
Feel free to execute the runnable jar to see the GUI and play with the simulation!
